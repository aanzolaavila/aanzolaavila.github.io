# Hello there

I'm a software engineer that graduated in 2020 with a bachelor degree on Systems Engineering at Escuela Colombiana de Ingenieria Julio Garavito.

This space is where I want to write some of my ideas and challenges that I find during my day to day life, not necessarily related to work.
